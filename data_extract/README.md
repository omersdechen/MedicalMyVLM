# data augmentations
## code explanation
augmentation.py will look for a folder named 'photos_to_augment' in it's 
parent folder. It will perform the user;s chosen augmentation on all photos.
It will create an output folder under 'augmented_photos' named 
'output_{augmentation}'.
As per this moment, augment_all is not usefull.
